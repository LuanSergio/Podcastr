Each event focus on different aspects of the proposed language/framework. [Click here](https://nextlevelweek.com/) to see more.

### Why did I decide to do this project?

I always loved puzzle and logic related games like Sudoku, Sokoban and Picross.
<br>
Since I really wanted to do something that could be challenging and could help me improve my logic, JS and CSS skills, I decided to recreate a game that would use a bunch of logic and that would put me out of my comfort zone.
<br>
While thinking about my options, I notice that I had no idea how it was to work with mouse events on JS (aside from the vanilla click), so the Picross seemed like a good way to take a real challenge.
